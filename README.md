# Covid Tracker
This project is to provide a platform on which one can look and get status of current situation nearby for example currently it very hard to find weather a person standing next to me has some symptoms of COVID-19 or not so the basic idea is that a registered user of this app can make ALERT and that way his locations will be store in database and then will be added on map so that other user could get a alert saying there is someone near you who might be corona positive.
